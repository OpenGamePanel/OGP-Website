Backup of the existing database can be done with following command:

$ mysqldump --user [username] -p [database] > backup.sql

Replace the [username] with username located in includes/config.inc.php and 
[database] with database located in same file. After executing the command
the password is asked (same as in config.inc.php).


*** Restore Database Backup ***

Backup can be restored with the following command:

$ mysql --user [username] -p [database] < backup.sql


*** Lost Admin Password ***

In case you lose the admin password you can reset the password with, for
example, the following command:

$ mysql --user [username] -p [database] 

Then type in the following command but change the OGP_USERNAME and NEW_PASSWORD
to the proper ones:

UPDATE ogp_users SET users_passwd=MD5('NEW_PASSWORD') 
WHERE ogp_users.users_login='OGP_USERNAME';

After this type quit to exit the MySQL prompt.
